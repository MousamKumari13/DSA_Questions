# Factorial of a Number
Problem Statement: Given a number X,  print its factorial.

To obtain the factorial of a number, it has to be multiplied by all the whole numbers preceding it. More precisely X! = X*(X-1)*(X-2) â€¦ 1.

Note: X  is always a positive number. 

Examples:

Example 1:
# Input: 
```X = 5```
# Output: 
```120```

Explanation: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1

Example 2:
# Input:
```X = 3```
# Output: 
```6```

Explanation: 3!=3*2*1

# Solution
```C++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int mulOfSeries(int n){
    if(n == 0) return 1 ;
    return n*mulOfSeries(n-1);
}
int main() {
    int n ;
    cin>>n;
    
   cout<<mulOfSeries(n);
    
    return 0;
}```

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
